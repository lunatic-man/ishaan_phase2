# SSTI1 
In this challenge, we had to achieve something called as Server Side Template Injection(SSTI) to achieve Remote Code Execution(RCE) on the website.

## Solution 
To solve this challenge, I followed the steps as listed below: 
- I misread the SSTI as SSTL, so that was something hilarious, but reading the hint I realized it was not a L but an I. Googling about SSTI, I came across a website called as PortSwigger. Luckily this website was pretty stacked and gave me all the things I needed to being with.

- On reading the website I got to know about something called as template engines and how we can find out what type of template engine we are using. This allowed me to figure out that it was a Jinja Template Engine as it returned 7 times 7 on using `{{ 7*'7' }}` after using `{{ 7*7 }}`.

- Having done this, I had to go online and figure out what to do so that I can execute commands on the website. This was pretty simple after I got to know the name of the template engine. Simply googling `SSTI on Jinja engine` gave me the results I wanted and the first site was helpful again. Reading through the article I got a precrafted command that allowed me to achieve RCE.

- Using this and changing the `id` in the command to `ls`, I got to see the files, one of which was `flag`. Changing the `ls` to `cat flag`, I got the flag as needed.

## Flag
`picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_bdc95c1a}`

## Notes
I did intially try reading the source code, but I found nothing useful and worthwhile there. Won't call it a tangent, but yes a dumb move as the name of what you had to do was literally given there.
