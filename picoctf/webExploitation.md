# Web Gauntlet
To solve this challenge, we had to pass through 5 rounds of SQLi with each level having newer filters. 

## Solution 
To solve this challenge, I followed the steps as listed below: 
- I first read through all the hints possible on the challenge to figure out what it was. I learned from the hints that the database was of SQLite type and that we had to always login as the admin.
- Using these hints, I went online and I looked up SQL injection. Luckily I found the website on the tope, i.e., PortSwigger. On reading the page I understood better how SQLi works and how I can use it. I also went up and found the official documentation page of SQLi where I learned the syntax for single line comments and multi line comments.

- After finding these, I started the instance and logged in for the first round and then crafted a query in username as `admin' --` with and any random password. This gave me access to the new round.

- In the second round, I checked the `filter.php` page and realised that `--` was filtered out, so I had to shift to multiline comments, i.e., `/*`. So my next query was `admin' /*` in the username and again a random password. This gave me access to the next round.

- Now in the third round, I got stuck for a while, and I discovered what was the error by a fluke. Before crafting a command, I first read the `filter.php`  again and learned that nothing I used in the previous command was filtered, so I happy crafted the same command again only to find it didn't work. And I got stuck on this, I tried using query terminators as well, i.e., `;`, but still the same error. I happened to skip the space in the previous query(hence the fluke), which allowed me to pass. I did not understand it at the time, but I realised later on that ` ` was also banned. This was not visible in the `filter.php` page. So the actual command was `admin'/*` which allowed me to move to the next level

- In the 4th round, `admin` itself was banned, but PortSwigger taught me about `||` to concatenate two strings, so I used that to spilt it and get access to next round using the command `ad'||'min'/*`.

- In the 5th round, nothing from the previous command was banned, so I simply used the same command again to move on.

- Then I got told to check the `filter.php` page where I learned that space was banned after Round3 and I also got the password.

## Notes
There might be a way of solving it by checking the response from the server by using a proxy, but I didn't work on it as mentor said that I was over complicating, hint did mention anaylzing raw hex that we get, possibly meaning space(in hex) was in there somewhere.

# SSTI1 
In this challenge, we had to achieve something called as Server Side Template Injection(SSTI) to achieve Remote Code Execution(RCE) on the website.

## Solution 
To solve this challenge, I followed the steps as listed below: 
- I misread the SSTI as SSTL, so that was something hilarious, but reading the hint I realized it was not a L but an I. Googling about SSTI, I came across a website called as PortSwigger. Luckily this website was pretty stacked and gave me all the things I needed to being with.

- On reading the website I got to know about something called as template engines and how we can find out what type of template engine we are using. This allowed me to figure out that it was a Jinja Template Engine as it returned 7 times 7 on using `{{ 7*'7' }}` after using `{{ 7*7 }}`.

- Having done this, I had to go online and figure out what to do so that I can execute commands on the website. This was pretty simple after I got to know the name of the template engine. Simply googling `SSTI on Jinja engine` gave me the results I wanted and the first site was helpful again. Reading through the article I got a precrafted command that allowed me to achieve RCE.

- Using this and changing the `id` in the command to `ls`, I got to see the files, one of which was `flag`. Changing the `ls` to `cat flag`, I got the flag as needed.

## Notes
I did intially try reading the source code, but I found nothing useful and worthwhile there. Won't call it a tangent, but yes a dumb move as the name of what you had to do was literally given there.

# Cookies
To solve this challenge, we had to keep on changing the value of the cookies and reloading the website till we found the correct one. 

## Solution 
To solve this challenge, I followed the steps as below: 
- I first opened the Developer's Tools to check the current value of the cookie. This was set as `-1`. So I typed in admin and tried reloading the page only to get an error. So I typed in what I saw at the screen which was `snickerdoodle`. This changed the value of the cookie to `0` as shown on screen

- Then I realised that we have to give mathematical numbers as the value and keep on checking and changing it. This was a tedious process. I did think of trying in steps of ten to find the last value, but there was no guarantee that it would be at the last value, so I kept on changing it every time to find the flag at value `18`.
