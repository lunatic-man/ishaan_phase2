# buffer overflow 0
To solve this challenge, we had to create a buffer overflow condition so that we could get the flag back. 

## Solution 
To solve this challenge, I followed the steps as listed below: 
- I first read through the code that we found in the challenge, and I tried understanding it. Did not understand the signal part, but rest of it was easy C code so I understood it fairly quickly.
- Next what I did was read through the hints provided in the challenge, and in that I got a hint to read the `BUGS` section of the `gets()` function. Following this hint, I found the official website where CWE-242 was shown. Reading through this page, I realised that basically `gets()` does not have a limit on how many characters I can enter and hence, causes a overflow.
![Website with Demonstrative Example of overflow in gets()]()  
- So I re-read the code to understand what was happening and I learned that I simply had to put a string with greater than 16 characters to get the answer. This gave me the flag as shown below:
```bash
15:32:07 ishaan-mishra@ishaan-mishra-Lenovo-G505s ~/Downloads  → cat vuln.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <signal.h>

#define FLAGSIZE_MAX 64

char flag[FLAGSIZE_MAX];

void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
  printf("%s\n", flag);
  fflush(stdout);
  exit(1);
}

void vuln(char *input){
  char buf2[16];
  strcpy(buf2, input);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){
  
  FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    printf("%s %s", "Please create 'flag.txt' in this directory with your",
                    "own debugging flag.\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  
  fgets(flag,FLAGSIZE_MAX,f);
  signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler); // Set up signal handler
  
  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);


  printf("Input: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  char buf1[100];
  gets(buf1); 
  vuln(buf1);
  printf("The program will exit now\n");
  return 0;
}

# Format String 0 
To solve this challenge, we had to use our knowledge of format strings to get to the flag. 

## Solution 
This was a pretty easy solution without much thinking needed. I simply followed the steps as below to get the flag: 
- I first read through the source code to understand what it did. Again, the signal part was confusing, but rest everything was pretty simple to grasp. I understood that we had to use the options on the menu to cause the system to break.
- Reading the hints confirmed this, as the second hint said that you need to try different options. So choosing the strings at random, I got the flag.
```bash
15:47:39 ishaan-mishra@ishaan-mishra-Lenovo-G505s ~/Downloads  → cat * 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

#define BUFSIZE 32
#define FLAGSIZE 64

char flag[FLAGSIZE];

void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
    printf("\n%s\n", flag);
    fflush(stdout);
    exit(1);
}

int on_menu(char *burger, char *menu[], int count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        if (strcmp(burger, menu[i]) == 0)
            return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

void serve_patrick();

void serve_bob();


int main(int argc, char **argv){
    FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
    if (f == NULL) {
        printf("%s %s", "Please create 'flag.txt' in this directory with your",
                        "own debugging flag.\n");
        exit(0);
    }

    fgets(flag, FLAGSIZE, f);
    signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler);

    gid_t gid = getegid();
    setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
