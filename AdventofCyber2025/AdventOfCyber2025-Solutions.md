## Day 0: Advent of Cyber Prep Track
On this day, we were taught about how to use the TryHackMe platform and we were also taught the basics of the various things related to cybersecurity that we will be learning about.

### Challenge 1 - Password Pandemonium 
In this challenge, we simply needed to create a new password. It had to be atleast 12 characters long, must include a uppercase, lowercase alphabet with numbers, and special characters and it must not be in the breached database.
I set the password as `S0Cmas25@2025`. This gave me the flag as given below.

#### Flag 
`THM{StrongStart}`

### Challenge 2 - The Suspicious Chocolate.exe 
In this challenge, we had to analyze a file `chocolate.exe` and determine whether it is safe or or infected. I simply scanned it and saw that it came from a suspicious address and hence I marked it as infected to get the flag as below. 

#### Flag
`THM{NotSoSweet}`

### Challenge 3 - Welcome to the AttackBox
In this challenge, we were taught how to use the AttackBox to successfully complete the challenges that we needed to solve. I simply followed the steps as told to get the flag. 

#### Flag 
`THM{Ready2Hack}`

### Challenge 4 - The CMD Conundrum 
In this challenge, we were taught the absolute basics of the command prompt and had to get the flag onto the CMD. 

#### Flag 
`THM{WhereIsMcSkidy}`


### Challenge 5 - Linux Lore 
In this challenge, we were taught how to operate Linux using command line and then find the hidden message. 

#### Flag 
`THM{TrustNoBunny}`

### Challenge 6 - The Leak in the List
In this challenge we had to check whether the email address given to us was a part of any data breach or not. 

#### Flag 
`THM{LeakedAndFound}`

### Challenge 7 - WiFi Woes in Wareville
In this challenge, we had to change the default login credentials from the basic ones to new ones. Doing this gives us the flag. 

#### Flag 
`THM{NoMoreDefault}`

### Challenge 8 - The App Trap 
In this challenge, we had to look for apps that had unusual access permissions(password vault acccess) and disable it. 

#### Flag 
`THM{AppTrapped}`

### Challenge 9 - The Chatbot Confession 
In this challenge, we had to correct the AI chatbot to not reveal sensitive and private information when someone gives it a prompt. 

#### Flag 
`THM{DontFeedTheBot}`

### Challenge 10 - The Bunny's Browser Trail 
In this challenge, we had to go through the logs to find the suspicious entry. This gave us the flag. 

#### Flag 
`THM{EastmasIsComing}`

### What I learned
This served as a basic reminder of the broad divisions of cyber security and what is expected of us when we try to solve a challenge. 

### Notes
1. AI chatbot challenge comes under prompt engineering, which is a new field that is coming up. This is important and does not fall under the normal domains of cyber security.
